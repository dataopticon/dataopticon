DataOpticon gives data scientists and machine learning practitioners the opportunity to learn how to successfully implement data driven projects within their companies by taking advantage of dataops, the new movement which seeks to bring to data science the same benefits that Devops brings to software engineering.

Learn how to take advantage of new insights around process, tooling and culture to reduce the time between data collection and delivering useful models to production.

This event is targeted at the practitioners: data scientists who want to get their work into production quickly (and learn how their models are performing in the wild), Devops staff who are struggling to get to grips with the new challenges that machine learning presents, and data science team leads who are tasked with combining the two!
